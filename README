Whiplace performs fast stream multiple replacement.

Getting started:

git clone git@github.com:gui11aume/whiplace.git
cd whiplace
make
./whiplace
./whiplace --key-check tests/keytest.txt
./whiplace tests/keytest.txt tests/targetest.txt



The key file must consist of one key-value pair per line,
separated by a tab. Subsequent tabs, if any, will be part
of the value. Keys specify what to match, values what to
replace the match with. Specifying no value leads to
deletion of the key (and lines with no key are ignored).

If several keys match the same position, whiplace will
use the longest (actually largest in dictionary order).
For example, 'abc' and 'ab' are possible matches against
'abcd'. In that case, 'abc' will be used and not 'ab',
because the match is longer. So 'ab' is a match only when
not followed by 'c', like in 'abde'.

Note that in the previous example 'bcd' would not match
'abcd' because 'abc' matches before, masking those letters
from other possible matches.
